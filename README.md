# kotlin-native-import
Import a kotlin native compiled code into C# console application

## Why?
I was triyng to study Kotlin and found Kotlin/Native. 
As a principaly C# developer, I asked myself if was possible to import a Kotlin/Native compiled code to a C#.NET application.

## How to use this project
This project already has compiled files for Kotlin/Native. 
Just build the project and and execute. 
You will see the output with a string comming from Kotlin file.
